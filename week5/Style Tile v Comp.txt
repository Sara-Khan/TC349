	I definitely see advantage to both style tiles and full comps; it just depends on the circumstances.
Personally I find comps to be more advantageous, due to the clarity that can be conveyed to a client on 
what precisely I want to pitch to them.	Now, I do believe that style tiles are great to convey succinct
information to a client, but for myself I find my creativity to be stifled by that approach. I prefer 
minimalist designs and a style tile, I believe, detracts from the artistic composition of the site.
