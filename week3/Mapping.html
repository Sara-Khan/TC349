		<h1>Mapping</h1>
	</header>
	<p>Although I can't specifically speak for the various other platforms that Facebook is supported on; for PC users the mapping consideration for the layout on the sign up page is extremely streamlined. Very little mouse manipulation is needed in order to navigate between the form fields and the sign up button is located equally close. This design keeps the user from having to traverse the entirety of their mousepad, regardless of the DPI or acceleration of the mouse. That, and the website still maintains a professional and easily translated layout. </p>
