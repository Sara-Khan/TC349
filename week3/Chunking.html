		<h1>Chunking</h1>
	</header>
	<p>Thesarus.com is an excellent example of a website that utilizes chunking techniques, especially when synonyms/antonyms are sorted by relevance. As is visible in the above screenshot, words that have the most relevance are accented by a background with high alpha channel. As the words or phrase become less relevant, so does the opacity decrease. I find that this visual element helps the brain to categorize and then store the information that the website is presenting.</p>
