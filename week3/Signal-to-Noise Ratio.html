	<p>YouTube is such a major success because is provides a very simple interface for people to access whatever it is they seek to watch or typically do watch. The website is coded to produce recomendations based upon your interests and relays them to the user in a very straight-forward manner. Considering that there are millions of videos available through their website, having them presented to you in a clean, and easily understood way give the viewer more time to focus on the content they seek, not the act of finding it. </p>
